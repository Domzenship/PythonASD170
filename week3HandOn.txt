---------------------------------------------------------------
week 3 Part 1 Assignment
Implement this program by using at least 3 user defined functions.

1) A value returning function

2) A function with parameter (s)

3) A function with both returning value and parameters. 

A “Make your pizza” program allows the user 
to see the available menu with different pizza sizes, 
various ingredients, and prices. The user can input 
one pizza topping at a time and returns a message that 
the user added [topping] to the pizza after each input. 
The program allows the user to indicate when they are finished 
adding toppings and finally outputs a message telling 
the user how many toppings were
 added to the imaginary pizza and its total cost.
