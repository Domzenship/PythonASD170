In the game of Lucky Sevens, the player rolls a pair of dice.
If the dots add up to 7, the player wins $4; otherwise,
the player loses $1.
Suppose that, to entice the gullible,
a casino tells players that there are lots of ways to win:
(1, 6), (2, 5),
and so on.
A little mathematical analysis reveals that there are not enough
ways to win to make the game worthwhile; however,
because many peopleâ€™s eyes glaze over at the first mention of mathematics,
 your challenge is to write a program that demonstrates
 the futility of playing the game.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 Your program should take as input the amount of money that the player wants
 to put into the pot,and play the game until the pot is empty. At that point,
 the program should print the number of rolls it took
 to break the player, as well as maximum amount of money in the pot.

#Modify your program from Page 101  (listed below),
#use the exact program requirements, and apply OOP design to it.
#Your new program should contain at least two classes.

maxdollars = 0


#create two classes

        self.dice1 = dice1
        return(self.dice1)
    def getdice2(self): #roll dice2
        dice2 = random.randint(1,6)

             rolltotal= d1 + d2
             if rolltotal ==7:
                dollars +=4
             else:
                 dollars -=1
             if dollars > maxdollars:
